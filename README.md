# Useful
Useful scripts and tools for all


## NEW!
Use the **BuildFatPackage.sh** to build distributable fat libraries, frameworks, and new XCFrameworks automatically whenever you push the build button in Xcode. (Xcode by default only builds for simulator OR device).

### Attach the script as a build script in your Xcode projects.
